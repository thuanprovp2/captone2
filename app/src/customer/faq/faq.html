                                        1. Can you deliver to schools?

                                    </a>

                                </h4>

                                    <p>Yes, but there are a few issues with deliveries to schools. We deliver them to
                                        the school office and it is the responsibility of the school to notify the
                                        recipient of their floral delivery. Upon occasion, schools can refuse the
                                        delivery. If this happens, we will notify you and attempt to get an alternate
                                        address for the recipient. If you want to have a delivery made to a school for
                                        Valentine's Day, we encourage you to send the arrangement the day before. This
                                        will increase the probability of a successful delivery.</p>
